<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

<p>Ambson Inc. ("Ambson", "we", "us" or "our") provides this Privacy Policy ("Policy") to inform our users ("users", "your" or "you") of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information we receive from users of any Ambson game provided on other websites or other third party sources (collectively, the "Services"). Ambson is not responsible for the actions of third party people or companies, the content of their sites, the use of information you provide to them or any products or services they may offer. Any link to those sites does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. If we decide to change this Policy, we will post those changes on this page and update the date at the top of the page. The changes will be effective when posted, and your continued use of the Services after the effective date of such change constitutes your consent to the terms of the revised Policy. Please check this page on a regular basis and whenever you use the Services so that you remain aware of what information we collect and how we use it.</p>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>Ambson uses information, including personal information, that you provide or we collect to provide and enhance the Services, to improve our games and related services, and to gather broad demographic information that does not personally identify you. We may use the information we collect for the following purposes:<br>
<ol type="i">
    <li>to contact you about your use of the Services, such as for administrative purposes or to provide you with customer service; </li>
    <li>to fulfill or respond to your requests, to process transactions, and to send you the communications you requested; </li>
    <li>to notify you about important changes to our policies or Services, </li>
    <li>to contact you regarding new and existing Ambson features, products and services, and special Ambson offers, promotions and events that we think you may find interesting and for other internal marketing, informational, product development and promotional purposes; </li>
    <li>to request feedback and to improve the Services and our product and service offerings, and develop new products and services; and </li>
    <li>to provide product support.</li>
</ol> 
</p>

<p>When we use the term "personal information" in this Policy, it can include an individual's first and last name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and a credit card or other account number.</p>

<h2>Via Social Networking Site</h2>

<p>When you use Ambson Services at a social networking site ("SNS"), you allow Ambson to access your profile information in accordance with the policies and terms of the SNS.</p>

<p>Such information may include, but is not limited to, your first and last name, your profile picture, your SNS user ID and respective user IDs of your friends that are connected to the Services, your gender, your birthday, and your email address.</p>

<p>In addition, Ambson may use some or all of your profile information as part of the features of the Services, such as game invites. Additionally, Ambson may use your profile picture in emails sent to individuals you chose to contact to invite to use the Services.</p>

<p>The information you allow Ambson to access is affected by the privacy settings that you have set at the SNS. You may control and learn more about these privacy settings at the applicable SNS.</p>

<h2>Via Game Bars and Cross Promotion</h2>

<p>The Services may display Ambson's or a third party's branded game bar ("Game Bar") or other cross promotion tools that are used to cross promote Ambson's Services and/or third party developer's services. By clicking on Ambson's Services' or a third party's services' icon, your user ID may be collected by the Game Bar and you will directed to the desired service.</p>

<p>We may also keep statistics of the Game Bar use on the aggregate basis.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>

<h3>Third Party Tools</h3>

<p>The Services may also contain third party tracking tools from service providers. Ambson may use these third parties' APIs/SDKs in our Services, which may enable these third parties to analyze user information. While these third parties may have access to your personal information in connection with the performance of services for Ambson, they may not use such information for any purpose other than providing their services.</p>

<h3>Service Providers and Affiliates</h3>

<p>We may use third party companies to perform services related to the Services and to assist in our marketing efforts. These services may include, but are not limited to, maintenance services, data storage, database management, web analytics, payment processing, hosting services and email services. They are obligated to use this information only to perform tasks on our behalf.</p>

<p>Ambson also may disclose or transfer your information to its corporate affiliates (for example, its subsidiaries or the parent corporation).</p>

<h3>Third Party Advertising</h3>

<p>We may use, store and share with third party advertisers certain technical information (including IP addresses) or aggregated information of the users of Ambson's Services such as general demographic and preference information. We may also allow advertisers to collect such technical or aggregate information that they may share with us. Such information collected may be used for the industry analysis, demographic profiling and to deliver targeted advertising.</p>
<h3>Offer Walls</h3>
<p>The Services may display an "offer wall" that is hosted by an offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users in exchange for completing an offer, fulfilling a survey or otherwise interacting with an advertisement. These are offers made by third party advertisers; not by Ambson.</p>
<p>These offers may be targeted to you based on certain information, such as your geographic area or other demographic information. After clicking on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be on the SNS.</p>
<p>We may need to share your user ID number with the offer wall provider. This identifier is used to ensure proper crediting of your account, prevent fraud or duplicate offers and to resolve any customer service inquiries that may arise. Once you complete an offer, you will then return to Ambson's Services.</p>
<h3>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h3>
<p>We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Ambson, such as to determine, bill and collect amounts owed to us, or to protect the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
<h3>Other Disclosures</h3>
<p><ul>
    <li>Ambson may share your information when you agree to our sharing your information with other third parties for their own marketing purposes subject to their separate privacy policies.</li>
    <li>We may share aggregate or anonymous information about you with advertisers, publishers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.</li>
</ul>
